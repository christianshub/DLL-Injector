## Introduction 

Remote DLL injection works by injecting a DLL (the payload) on disk into a remote process that calls `LoadLibrary` (or the native `LdrLoadDll`), thereby forcing a DLL to be loaded in the context of that process. Once the remote process loads the DLL, the OS automatically calls the DLLâ€™s `DllMain` function, which is defined by the creator of the DLL. This function contains the hack and has as much access to the system as the process in which it is running. 

## Step-by-step approach

- Step 1: Get the function, `LoadLibraryA`
- Step 2: Open the target process specified by the user of the injector
- Step 3: Allocate space for the DLL
- Step 4: Write the DLL location to the space we allocated in step 3
- Step 5: Launch the DLL using `LoadLibraryA` from step 1
- Step 6: Close handles
